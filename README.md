# JessieDebloater
This is a script that removes all unnecessary applications and dependencies from Raspbian Jessie, while leaving it fully functional in terms of Python Development and GUI usage.

Tested and working on Raspbian Jessie 2017-07-05 Image.
This script should work on all Rasbian Jessie images without any fatal errors.

**INSTALLATION:**

Step 1 - You'll need to clone this repository to get the script.
> git clone https://github.com/LiamZC/JessieDebloater

Step 2 - Enter the newly made directory with the debloat script.
> cd JessieDebloater

Step 3 - Give the script the needed permissions.
> sudo chmod +x JessieDebloater.sh

Step 4 - Run the script.
> sh ./JessieDebloater.sh | sudo sh

**The process takes a long time to complete, so I suggest you get some entertainment/snacks ready for the wait. :)**

# RaspbianDebloater
This is a script that removes all unnecessary applications and dependencies from Raspbian, while leaving it fully functional in terms of Python Development and GUI usage.

Tested and working on Raspbian Jessie 2017-07-05 Image, which can be downloaded from the DOWNLOADS section of this readme.

This script should work on all Rasbian images without any fatal errors.
